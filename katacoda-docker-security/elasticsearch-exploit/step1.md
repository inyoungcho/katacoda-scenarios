To start we'll launch a container running Elasticsearch 1.4.2 which we'll later exploit.

#### Task
Launch the container

`docker run -d -p 9200:9200 --name es benhall/elasticsearch:1.4.2`{{execute}}

#### Container Security

By default Docker drops certain Linux capabilities and blocks syscalls to add a default level of security. As a result, the harder is isolated and the host protect from certain attack angles a hacker might use.
