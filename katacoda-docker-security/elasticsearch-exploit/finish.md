In this scenario we demonstrated how easy it could be for attackers to break into applications running inside a container. By default Docker's security protects the host and system and exposing information such as .ssh keys or passwords.

However, it demonstrates that people still need to be aware of which version of software they're running and potential vulnerabilities which is may contain. Docker's security gives you a greater level of protection than running the process on the host, however there still needs to be a strong security practice in place.

In future scenarios we cover additional Docker security features to reduce the attack surface area.
